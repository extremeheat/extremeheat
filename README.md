### Hi there 👋

I like science and making things!

🔭 I’m currently working on
  -  [JSPyBridge](https://github.com/extremeheat/JSPyBridge) - A language bridge to connect and interoperate JavaScript and Python bidirectionally
  -  Video game networking libraries - <img width=20 height=20 src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft/images/f/fe/GrassNew.png/revision/latest?cb=20190903234415"/> [PrismarineJS/bedrock-protocol](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/bedrock-protocol/), [PrismarineJS/mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/)
  -  Node.js - [Alot of](https://github.com/extremeheat/node-raknet-native) [things](https://github.com/extremeheat/node-leveldb-zlib) [around](https://github.com/ProtoDef-io/node-protodef) [Node](https://github.com/extremeheat/protodef-yaml)..
